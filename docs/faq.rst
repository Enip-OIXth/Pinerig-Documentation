These single-bone rig types are used to generate features than can tedious to repeat multiple time throughout the metarig.
They must be applied separately to every bone even within a connected chain, and can have connected children controlled by a different rig type.
This is unlike chain-based rig types that usually consume the whole connected chain.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
======


- **Can I use the rig in a game engine (Unity, UE, Godot…)?**
    | Short answer is yes, but you may need to:
    | -	Simplify the rig (bake animations to deform bones only).
    | -	Remove extra control bones and constraints not supported in game engines (Most commonly change all `STRETCH_TO` constraints to `DAMPED_TRACK`).
    | To streamline this process, I greatly recommend the Game Rig Tools addon by CGDive: https://superhivemarket.com/products/game-rig-tools-blender-addon-game-rigs
- **As a Rigger, do I need Rigify installed to use a Pinerig?**
    | Yes, this addon relies heavily on Rigify in order to work. Fortunately, Rigify is free and bundled with Blender.
- **As an Animator, do I need Rigify/Pinerig installed to use a rig generated by it?**
    | No. Once generated, the rig is just a standard Blender armature. You can share it with others who don't have Rigify/Pinerig installed, it will still work. 
    | In order to have the custom UI to work with all its tools (FK/Ik snapping, bones layers…), be sure to provide the `rig_ui.py` script that comes with the generated rig. 
    | Execute it via the scripting tab if the Rigify Rig UI does not appear automatically when selecting the rig.
- **Can I regenerate the rig after making changes?**
    | Yes, but be careful: regenerating overwrites the rig. If you've added custom tweaks, you may lose them. 
    | Best practice is to keep a copy of your meta-rig and regenerate as needed. 
    | Use Rigify's `basic.raw_copy` and `basic.super_copy` rig types to your advandage.
- **Can I sell characters rigged with Pinerig?**
    | Yes! Just be sure to include the `rig_ui.py` script linked with your rig so that your client can use the rigify utilities.
