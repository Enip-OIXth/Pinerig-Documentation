Most of these rig types emulates the way their default Rigify counterparts work while adding new options and features.
The goal is to make every pinerig_type compatible with any default Rigify rig types, allowing users to mix those feature sets safely.

This documentation thus heavily quotes `Blender's own Rigify documentation <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/rigging/rigify/rig_types/index.html>`_, in order to avoid switching between new features added with this feature-set and the default rigify behaviour of most pinerig_types.
